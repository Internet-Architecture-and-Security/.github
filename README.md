# Internet Architecture and Security

This project aims to identify and address security vulnerabilities within the fundamental TCP/IP protocols, with a focus on enhancing the overall security of the Internet. By analyzing and mitigating potential threats and weaknesses in TCP/IP protocols, we strive to fortify the foundation of Internet architecture, ensuring a safer and more resilient online environment for users worldwide.

## projects

- TCP Hijacking in NAT-Enabled Wi-Fi Networks: This project delves into the security risks posed by TCP hijacking in NAT-enabled Wi-Fi networks. By exploring the mechanisms and potential exploits associated with TCP hijacking, we aim to develop robust countermeasures to safeguard network communications in Wi-Fi environments.

- Packet-Size Side Channel Attack: This project investigates the packet-size side channel attack, a sophisticated method used by attackers to glean sensitive information from network traffic based on packet sizes. Through in-depth analysis and innovative solutions, we seek to mitigate the risks posed by this type of attack and bolster network security.

- TCP Hijacking via Mixed IPID Assignment: This project focuses on TCP hijacking techniques that leverage mixed IPID (Identification Protocol ID) assignment. By understanding the intricacies of mixed IPID assignment and its potential implications for TCP hijacking, we aim to devise effective strategies to detect and prevent such attacks, thereby enhancing the security posture of Internet communication protocols.
